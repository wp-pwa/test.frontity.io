It is third in income from tourism due to shorter duration of visits. France has 37 sites inscribed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_France" target="_blank">UNESCO's World Heritage List</a> and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, and rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism).
<h3>Les Plus Beaux Villages</h3>

Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the association Les Plus Beaux Villages de France (litt. "The Most Beautiful Villages of France"). The "Remarkable Gardens" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the French Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es that hosts several million visitors a year.
<h3>The French Riviera</h3>
With more than 10 millions tourists a year, the French Riviera (or C√¥te d'Azur), in south-east France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris region. It benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 115 kilometres of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants. Each year the C√¥te d'Azur hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet.
