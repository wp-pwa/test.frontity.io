On board were almost 2,000 people, mostly immigrating Europeans. Through the emerging light of the new dawn, the Statue of Liberty came into view. The appearance of the great icon had them mesmerized. They had arrived at their new home, America.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Among the people on board was a little girl from Hungary. Her name was Julia, and she was four years old. She held a small rag doll tightly in her arms. At that moment in time, it was the only link she had to security and happiness.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Eight days earlierJulia had hugged her poppa good-bye. She remembered his stubbly beard tickling her face. He had reached into the pocket of his big wool overcoat and pulled out a surprise. It was a doll. He smiled and said, â€œFor you, Shkutabella (my little pretty).  Her name is Rachel, and I made her for you. As long as you have her, I will always be with you even if I am not there. Do you understand?â€</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Julia nodded her head up and down, and her mom said, â€œPlease Bollassar, please come with us. I do not like going without you.â€</span></p> <div id='aleteia-welcome'><script type='text/javascript'> googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display( 'aleteia-welcome' ); } ); </script></div><p><span style="font-weight:400;">â€œViola, it is all right. I will be over in a year. My brother George will take care of you. It is all right.â€</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Viola and Julia had boarded the ship and set off. Just a few days into their journey, as the lonely mother and daughter stood on the deck, a life-boat broke free from its support cable. It fell and hit Viola, killing her instantly. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Juliaâ€™s mom had been standing next to her and then she was lying lifeless on the deck. The childâ€™s young mind could not understand why her mom did not move. She screamed at her to wake up. That would never happen.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">When the ship docked at the pier, all Julia knew was fear and loneliness.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">At Ellis Island, a bizarre series of events saw Julia shuffled from one official to another and when a lady smiled at her, the official nearby assumed they were together and made Julia go with the lady. The woman took Julia as far as Broome and Varick Streets in lower Manhattan. She told the child to stay there and walked away. Just like that, Julia had become another abandoned child on the streets of the city.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Little Julia, holding Rachel, had been standing in the same spot for more than an hour. She was cold, hungry, and frightened beyond belief when the beat cop, Paddy Dolan, approached her. He was instantly smitten with the dark-haired, blue-eyed child and asked her her name. Hesitatingly she said, â€œJulia.â€ </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Officer Dolan brought her with him to the station-house, and after checking as much as anyone could in 1906, she was declared an orphan. But this orphan was not going to an orphanage. Paddy Dolan brought her home.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Paddyâ€™s wife, Aileen, a wee wisp of a gal from County Galway in Ireland, could not have children. Paddy and Aileen adopted Julia, and she became Julie Dolan. She grew up to be a teacher, married a man named Tommy Oâ€™Rourke (also a policeman), and they had three children: two boys and a girl. The girl was named Viola.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">On Thanksgiving Day 1951, Julia, her daughter Viola, and Violaâ€™s four-year-old daughter, Karen, went to the Macyâ€™s Thanksgiving Day Parade. They stood in the crowd at 63</span><span style="font-weight:400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Street and Central Park West and, after Santa had passed by, Viola suggested that they go to the Squireâ€™s Restaurant a few blocks away. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Karen was holding Rachel, Grandma Juliaâ€™s doll. Karen loved the doll and, in a moment of weakness, Grandma Julia had allowed her to take the doll with her to the parade. Rachel had not been out of the house in more than 40 years.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">They sat in a booth at Squire&#8217;s and Karen placed Rachel on the table. Julia reached over and fingered the doll lovingly. Suddenly a man stood by their table. He was old and weathered and quite nervous. A chill ran down Juliaâ€™s spine. The man pointed to the doll and nervously said, â€œExcuse meâ€¦is..is that doll named Rachel?â€</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Viola, not seeing her mother turning pale, answered, â€œWhy yes, how could you know such a thing?â€</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">As tears fell from the old manâ€™s eyes, he looked at Julia and softly said, â€œIs it really you, Shkutabella?â€</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Julia jumped from her seat and threw her arms around the old man. â€œOh Poppa,  Poppa, Poppa. I canâ€™t believe it. Yes it is. It is. It is ME.â€</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">HAPPY THANKSGIVING</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br /> </span></p> <div class="bkreadmore"> <img width="150" height="75" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/aleteia/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,w_150,h_75/https://aleteiaen.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/web3-love-letters-written-war-mail-courtesy-of-elizabeth-wise.jpg%3Fw%3D1200?ssl=1" /> <div class="text-container-with-image"> <div class="read-more"><em>Read more:</em></div> <a href="http://aleteia.org/2017/05/15/an-american-soldiers-love-letters-from-world-war-i/">  <strong>An American soldierâ€™s touching love letters from World War I</strong></a> </div></div>";s:10:"post_title";s:57:"A real-life miracle at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:56:"a-real-life-miracle-at-the-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-11-23 14:30:45";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-11-23 12:30:45";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:31:"https://test.frontity.io/?p=426";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
