And this week is a great time to promote them.</h2><p><span style="font-weight:400;">Social scientists have discovered a powerful answer to poverty, crime, and brokenness. They call it ‚Äúthe sequence,‚Äù and it is perhaps the single most important proposal for the future of America.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Thanksgiving is the year‚Äôs most important holiday in one respect. Easter is more fundamental to the faith, Christmas is better at winning souls to Christ, and July 4 is even more patriotic ‚Äî but Thanksgiving is a unique celebration of the most important reality on earth: the family.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">It would be hard to overestimate the importance of the family today.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">To demonstrate its power, social scientists coined the term ‚Äúthe success sequence‚Äù to describe how some Americans practically guarantee a high degree of success to themesleves ‚Äî while others don‚Äôt.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">The sequence goes like this: First, stay in school and earn a high school diploma, second, get married, and then ‚Äî and only then ‚Äî have children. That‚Äôs it. </span></p> <div id='aleteia-welcome'><script type='text/javascript'> googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display( 'aleteia-welcome' ); } ); </script></div><p><span style="font-weight:400;">Dr. W. Bradford Wilcox, professor and director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, has been studying the sequence for years. He and researcher Wendy Wang recently tracked a group of young adults to see if ‚Äúthe sequence‚Äù worked with millennials.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Writing in the </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Wall Street Journal</span><span style="font-weight:400;">, Wang said that in their study, ‚Äúat ages 28 to 34, 53% of millennials who had failed to complete all three steps were poor. The poverty rate dropped to 31% among millennials who completed high school, 16% among those who had a diploma and a full-time job, and 3% for millennials who also put marriage before the baby carriage. Among childless and unmarried millennials 28 to 34 who followed the education and work steps, the poverty rate was 8%.‚Äù</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">They found the sequence worked regardless of race and economic background ‚Äî and it actually served to lift low-income earners out of poverty. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">‚ÄúEighty percent of those with lower-income backgrounds made it into middle- or upper-income brackets when they followed all three steps, versus only 44% for those who missed one or more steps.‚Äù</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">As powerful as the sequence might be, it has its detractors. Two University of Pennsylvania law professors wrote an </span><a target="_blank" href="http://www2.philly.com/philly/opinion/commentary/paying-the-price-for-breakdown-of-the-countrys-bourgeois-culture-20170809.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in support of the sequence last year ‚Äî and were </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-cant-be-debated-on-campus-1518792717"><span style="font-weight:400;">bitterly attacked</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. Critics said that the sequence is class-based and biased. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Wilcox acknowledges the income disparity in those who follow the sequence. In fact, that is part of his point.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Those in upper income are far more likely to follow the sequence than those in lower incomes. Nearly 70 percemt of millennials ages 28 to 34 from low-income families missed one or more steps in the sequence ‚Äî only 35 percent of upper-income millennials missed one. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">But the point of talking about the sequence at all, he said, is to improve those numbers for all ‚Äî especially the poor.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">He also praises Michelle Obama‚Äôs recent book for upholding an important corollary to the sequence: Stay together once you‚Äôre married, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/michelle-obamas-advice-for-a-lasting-marriage-get-help-when-you-need-it"><span style="font-weight:400;">no matter what it takes</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.</span></p> <div class="bkreadmore"> <img width="150" height="75" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/aleteia/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,w_150,h_75/https://aleteiaen.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/web3-couple-married-husband-wife-woman-man-hug-forgivness-comfort-shutterstock.jpg%3Fw%3D1200?ssl=1" /> <div class="text-container-with-image"> <div class="read-more"><em>Read more:</em></div> <a href="http://aleteia.org/2018/09/29/just-stay-married-darn-it/">  <strong>Just stay married, darn it</strong></a> </div></div> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Which brings us back to Thanksgiving ‚Äî a perfect time to promote the sequence in your family.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">The psychological benefits of Thanksgiving are enormous. In a world of superficial ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù connection, Thanksgiving puts us face to face with cousins, nephews, aunts, and grandparents &#8212; </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">face to face. </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">A ritual meal is a perfect way to root a family and its personal history into the history of the nation as a whole. They establish the family in our imaginations as a real thing that exists across time and space. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">And the Thanksgiving table &#8212; it</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> is a perfect place to share the giant benefits of marriage and family ‚Äî benefits far beyond what we imagine.</span></p> <div class="bkreadmore"> <img width="150" height="75" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/aleteia/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,w_150,h_75/https://aleteiaen.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/web-boy-rabbit-aprilphoto-shutterstock_111017531.jpg%3Fw%3D1200?ssl=1" /> <div class="text-container-with-image"> <div class="read-more"><em>Read more:</em></div> <a href="http://aleteia.org/2016/06/02/on-thursdays-our-family-gives-thanks-in-all-circumstances/">  <strong>On Thursdays, Our Family Gives Thanks In All Circumstances</strong></a> </div></div> <div class="bkreadmore"> <img width="150" height="75" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/res.cloudinary.com/aleteia/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,w_150,h_75/https://aleteiaen.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/web-mother-child-close-brian-cc.jpg%3Fw%3D1200?ssl=1" /> <div class="text-container-with-image"> <div class="read-more"><em>Read more:</em></div> <a href="http://aleteia.org/2017/01/20/could-marriage-be-the-answer-to-child-poverty/">  <strong>Could marriage be the answer to child poverty, or just part of the answer?</strong></a> </div></div>";s:10:"post_title";s:44:"Celebrate the success sequence this Thursday";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:44:"celebrate-the-success-sequence-this-thursday";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-11-23 14:04:29";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-11-23 12:04:29";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:31:"https://test.frontity.io/?p=394";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
