<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gullfoss" target="_blank">Gullfoss</a> is one of the most popular <a href="https://test.frontity.io/iceland/">tourist attractions in Iceland</a>. The wide Hv铆t谩 rushes southward, and about a kilometre above the falls it turns sharply to the right and flows down into a wide curved three-step "staircase" and then abruptly plunges in two stages (11 metres or 36 feet, and 21 metres or 69 feet) into a crevice 32 metres (105 ft) deep. The crevice, about 20 metres (66 ft) wide and 2.5 kilometres (1.6 mi) in length, extends perpendicular to the flow of the river. The average amount of water running down the waterfall is 140 cubic metres (4,900 cu ft) per second in the summer and 80 cubic metres (2,800 cu ft) per second in the winter. The <a href="https://test.frontity.io/sample-page/">highest flood</a> measured was 2,000 cubic metres (71,000 cu ft) per second.
<h3>An iconic waterfall of Iceland</h3>

<p class="2"><p class="3"><div class="4">During the first half of the 20th century and some years into the late 20th century, there was much speculation about using Gullfoss to generate electricity. During this period, the waterfall was rented indirectly by its owners, T贸mas T贸masson and Halld贸r Halld贸rsson, to foreign investors. However, the investors' attempts were unsuccessful, partly due to lack of money. The waterfall was later sold to the state of Iceland, and is now protected.</div></p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Iceland is not a destination. Its an adventure set in stunning scenery.</p>
</blockquote>
Sigr铆冒ur T贸masd贸ttir, the daughter of T贸mas T贸masson, was determined to preserve the waterfall's condition and even threatened to throw herself down. Although it is widely believed, the very popular story that Sigr铆冒ur saved the waterfall from exploitation is untrue. <a href="http://www.nat.is/travelguideeng/gullfoss_sigridur_tomasdottir.htm" target="_blank">A stone memorial to Sigri冒ur</a>, located above the falls, depicts her profile.
