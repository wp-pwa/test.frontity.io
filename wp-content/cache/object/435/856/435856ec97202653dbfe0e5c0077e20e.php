James Martin&#8217;s Catholic talk show, <em>Faith in Focus</em>, he discussed his own struggle with the faith in his younger years.</p> <p>The late-night star told the Jesuit priest that there was once a time when his faith was not held firm and he considered himself &#8220;convicted of [his] atheism.&#8221; However this all changed in 1986, when a 22-year-old Colbert received an unexpected gift while walking down the wintry streets of Chicago.</p> <blockquote><p>‚ÄúI had lost my faith in God, to my great grief,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúI was sort of convinced that I had been wrong all this time that I had been taught something that wasn‚Äôt true.‚Äù</p> <p>&#8220;I was walking down the street and someone handed me a little green <em>New Testament, Proverbs, and Psalms</em>. It must have been humid and brought up to the cold because it was frozen and you kinda had to snap it. It was a really cold Chicago day.</p> <p>&#8220;I opened it up to a little glossary in the front and it said basically verses to read based upon [different situations]. So I went to &#8216;anxiety&#8217; and it was Matthew chapter 5, it was the sermon &#8216;So I say to you do not worry, for who among you by worrying can change a single hair on your head or add a cubit to the span of his life?&#8217; and I was absolutely, immediately lightened.</p> <div id='aleteia-welcome'><script type='text/javascript'> googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display( 'aleteia-welcome' ); } ); </script></div><p>&#8220;For the first time I understood the real meaning of the phrase, &#8216;It spoke to me.&#8217; Like it read off the page. The words of Christ read off the page with no effort. So I stood on the street in the cold and read the sermon. And my life has never been the same.</p> <p>&#8220;This gift of religion is something that can only be given in this way &#8230; And therefore you should be humble in accepting this act of love and see what it is they gave you without rejecting it.&#8221;</p></blockquote> <p>Father Martin responded, &#8220;That&#8217;s beautiful, the image of you standing at the corner. I mean the whole metaphor of the Gospels being frozen and needing to be cracked open is also very powerful.&#8221;</p> <p>A smile spread across Colbert&#8217;s face along with the amused expression of sudden realization, &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought about that!&#8221;</p> <p>See the whole interview, along with more of Faith in Focus&#8217; programing below:</p> <p><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='1440' height='810' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DDDCQIaEsHE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'></iframe></span></p>";s:10:"post_title";s:58:"Stephen Colbert talks about why he returned to Catholicism";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:58:"stephen-colbert-talks-about-why-he-returned-to-catholicism";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-11-23 13:34:21";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-11-23 11:34:21";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:31:"https://test.frontity.io/?p=370";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
