Antelope Canyon is a slot canyon in the American Southwest. It is located on Navajo land east of Page, Arizona. Antelope Canyon includes <strong>two separate, scenic slot canyon sections</strong>, referred to individually as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antelope_Canyon#Upper_Antelope_Canyon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upper Antelope Canyon</a>" or "The Crack"; and "Antelope Canyon" or "The Corkscrew".

The Navajo name for Upper Antelope Canyon is Ts√© bigh√°n√≠l√≠n√≠, which means <strong><em>"the place where water runs through rocks."</em></strong> Lower Antelope Canyon is Hazdistaz√≠ (advertised as "Hasdestwazi" by the Navajo Parks and Recreation Department), or "spiral rock arches." Both are located within the LeChee Chapter of the Navajo Nation
<h3><strong>Lower Antelope Canyon</strong></h3>
Lower Antelope Canyon, called Hazdistaz√≠, or "spiral rock arches" by the Navajo Indians, are located a few miles away. Prior to the installation of metal stairways, visiting the canyon required climbing along pre-installed ladders in certain areas. Even following the installation of stairways, it is a more difficult hike than Upper Antelope. It is longer, narrower in spots, and even footing is not available in all areas. At the end, the climb out requires several flights of stairs.

Despite these limitations, Lower Antelope Canyon draws a considerable number of photographers, though casual sightseers are much less common there than in Upper.

The lower canyon is in the shape of a "V" and shallower than the Upper Antelope. Lighting is better in the early hours and late morning.
