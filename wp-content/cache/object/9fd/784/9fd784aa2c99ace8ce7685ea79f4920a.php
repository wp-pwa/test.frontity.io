Iceland is volcanically and geologically active on a large scale; this defines the landscape in various ways. The interior mainly consists of a plateau characterized by sand fields, mountains and glaciers, while many big glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Warmed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream" target="_blank">Gulf Stream</a>, Iceland has a temperate climate relative to its latitude and provides a habitable environment and nature.

The volcanic eruption of Laki in 1783â€“1784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island's population. In addition, the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa for several months afterward, and affected climates in other areas.

Iceland has many geysers, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geysir" target="_blank">Geysir</a>, from which the English word is derived, and the famous Strokkur, which erupts every 8â€“10 minutes. After a phase of inactivity, Geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000. Geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often.
