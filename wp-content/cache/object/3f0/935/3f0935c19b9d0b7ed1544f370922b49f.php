No one knew it was </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">this </span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">bad. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">â€œItâ€™s a surprise even to people like myself,â€ said Dr. Christopher Murray, who worked on the study. â€œThe idea that itâ€™s half the countries in the world will be a huge surprise to people.â€</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">In fact, University of Washingtonâ€™s Murray told </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/08/health/global-burden-disease-fertility-study/index.html"><span style="font-weight:400;">CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> on November 9, â€œThe world is really divided into two groups. In a generation, the issueâ€™s not going to be about population growth. It&#8217;s going to be about population decline or relaxing immigration policies.â€</span></p> <div id='aleteia-welcome'><script type='text/javascript'> googletag.cmd.push( function() { googletag.display( 'aleteia-welcome' ); } ); </script></div><p><b>Who is growing and who is dropping?</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">The results published November 8 in </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/gbd"><span style="font-weight:400;">The Lancet</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> medical journal followed trends in every country from 1950 to 2017.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Over that time period, the world average of 4.7 children per woman has dropped to 2.4 in 2017.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">But if you look at it country by country you see a wide disparity. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Countries with the fewest children include Poland, South Korea, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Japan. In Taiwan, women average only 1 child. The most fertile countries include several in Africa, as well as Afghanistan, with an average 4-7 children per family.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Niger has a bountiful future with women having 7.1 children each on average. The population of the Island of Cyprus wonâ€™t last long, with women there having one child on average.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">The U.S. fertility rate is at 1.8 children per woman â€” but it would be much lower without immigration.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">While those who warn about population growth point out that the total number of people on the planet is increasing, the ratio of woman to child per country is important â€” because it shows which societies will sustain themselves and which canâ€™t.</span></p> <p><b>Why are women no longer having babies?</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Traditionally, drops in fertility rates followed economic adversity. When the economy slows down, so does baby-making. But now lower fertility rates accompany economic growth. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">The reasons include better health care keeping more infants and children alive, which means families have fewer children since most offspring are now expected to survive. But other major factors are an aggressive contraceptive industry and womenâ€™s changing lifestyles.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">The BBC </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46118103?mod=djem10point"><span style="font-weight:400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> on the </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Lancet</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> study quoted several women who have stopped having children. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">â€œWeâ€™d rather give our daughter the best of everything than have multiple children that we can just about feed and clothe,â€ said Rachel Jacobs, 38. â€œI donâ€™t want to ever have to say that she canâ€™t go to a party or have a new Christmas jumper.â€</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">A separate article </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-45201725"><span style="font-weight:400;">quoted</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> 24-year-old Jang Yun-hwa in South Korea saying, â€œI have no plans to have children, ever. â€¦ I donâ€™t want the physical pain of childbirth. And it would be detrimental to my career.â€</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">â€œIâ€™m not having children because I want to save the planet,â€ said Anna Hughes, 35, of Great Britain, in a video</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/stories-43699464/i-m-not-having-children-because-i-want-to-save-the-planet"><span style="font-weight:400;"> interview</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">. â€œThe best thing I can do for the environment is not have any children.â€ She said if she got pregnant, she would have an abortion. </span></p> <p><b>The future will belong to those who have children.</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">What do countries with very few replacements look like?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">â€œThe country thatâ€™s probably the most concerned about this already is China, where the number of workers is now starting to decline, and that has an immediate effect on economic growth potential,â€ Murray said. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">China is relaxing its one-child policy â€” but it may be too late. In addition to lacking workers, a fifth of Chinaâ€™s homes are empty, reported </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-08/a-fifth-of-china-s-homes-are-empty-that-s-50-million-apartments?mod=djem10point"><span style="font-weight:400;">Bloomberg</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> news â€” more than 50 million apartments and houses have no inhabitants.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Fertile countries have a far brighter future. They are a good place to invest your money, said Hans Rosling, a Swedish professor and demographic â€œprophetâ€ who died in February. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">â€œYou will find an emerging China in Africa,â€ he told the</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-39211144"><span style="font-weight:400;"> BBC</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> in a final interview. â€œGo there to invest if you want to earn money, if you want to have nice pensions when you retire, place part of your capital there because there you will see fast growth.â€</span></p> <p><b>Sacrifice and self-giving turns out to be good for our futures on earth as well as our future in eternity.</b></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">The prophet St. John Paul said it best: â€œThe measure of your success will be the measure of your generosity.â€</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Those nations whose families put children first and sacrifice comfort for family will see economic growth. Those who donâ€™t will fail. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight:400;">Perhaps this is what it means for the meek to inherit the earth.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:75:"New population research shows half the worldâ€™s countries are disappearing";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:72:"new-population-research-shows-half-the-worlds-countries-are-disappearing";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-11-23 14:07:03";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-11-23 12:07:03";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:31:"https://test.frontity.io/?p=401";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
