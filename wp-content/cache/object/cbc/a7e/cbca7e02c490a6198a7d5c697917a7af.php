<h3>Tourism in Romania</h3>
However, the number of tourists has decreased dramatically in recent years, in fact, in 2004 there were 5,9 millions of tourists. Only in 2012 the number of tourists has started to grow again.

The most visited cities are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest" target="_blank">Bucharest</a>, BraÈ™ov, Sibiu, Cluj-Napoca, TimiÈ™oara, IaÈ™i, and ConstanÈ›a. The most significant natural attractions are the Danube, the Carpathian Mountains, and the Black Sea.
<h3>The Carpathian Mountains</h3>
The Carpathian Mountains or Carpathians are a mountain range system forming an arc roughly 1,500 km long across Central and Eastern Europe, making them the second-longest mountain range in Europe (after the Scandinavian Mountains, 1,700 km.

They provide the habitat for the largest European populations of brown bears, wolves, chamois and lynxes, with the highest concentration in Romania, as well as over one third of all European plant species. The Carpathians and their foothills also have many thermal and mineral waters, with Romania having one-third of the European total.
