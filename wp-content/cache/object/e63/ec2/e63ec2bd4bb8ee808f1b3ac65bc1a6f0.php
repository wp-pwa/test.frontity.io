So they tend not to flock to shelters,‚Äù Daniel Grimm, director of the agency explained to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/as-california-fires-continue-to-burn-catholic-charities-aids-victims-56899">CNA</a>.</p> <p>‚Äú[But] later on, we deal with low-income people who have lost their jobs from not being able to go into work because of road closures, and also tenants who have lost their rental property and need to find a new place. Often they‚Äôre not in a position to come up with a new deposit, new first month‚Äôs rent,‚Äù he said.</p> <p>To make donation to victims of the California fires, visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.catholiccharitiesusa.org/">Catholic Charities USA</a> website.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:44:"Over 600 now missing in California wildfires";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:44:"over-600-now-missing-in-california-wildfires";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2018-11-23 13:51:23";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2018-11-23 11:51:23";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:31:"https://test.frontity.io/?p=379";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
